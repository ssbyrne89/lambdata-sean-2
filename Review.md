On your cleaner_funcs line 16 the second 'Date' has a space appearing as 'Date ' which is small but may cause issues in the future as python can be picky.

I really like the train test val split as I was thinking of doing something similar.

Honestly this is exactly the type of thing that saves time so... great job?!
